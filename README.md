# GraplerGuide_kodi_addon

Kodi Addon for Grapplers Guide Website by Jason Scully.

Add your username and password in the setting section for the addon.

Basically it mimics the website section menu, and you can drill down from there on what you want to see.
Usefull if you want to practice in front of the TV and you have kodi home theatre installed.

...Still a bit buggy (I have a few errors which don't seem to impact the overall functionality)
